# Crop-Recommendation-System

## Introduction

Machine Learning is well equipped when it comes to analyzing data regarding soil conditions, including moisture level, temperature, 
and chemical makeup, all of which have an impact upon crop growth and livestock well-being.

Today in agriculture, this can allow crops to be grown at much higher precision, enabling farmers to treat plants and animals almost 
individually, which in turn significantly increases the effectiveness of farmers' decisions.

Using this can develop means to even predict harvest yields and evaluate crop quality for individual plant species to detect crop disease 
and weed infestations which were previouly impossible!

## Contents 

In this project, I have implemented several Machine Learning Algorithms to improve the efficiency of the model built.

## Algorithms:
  
  * K means Clustering
  * Decision tree classifier
  * Gradient Boost Classifier
  * KNN Classifier
  * Random Forest Classifier 
  * Logistic Regression
  * Data visualization
  * Finding the hiddden patterns
  * Prediction
  
# Accuracy:
    * GradientBoostingClassifier : 91.4%
    * KNeighborsClassifier :90.4%
    * RandomForestClassifier : 94%
    * XGBClassifier : 93.4%
    * LogisticRegression : 90%
